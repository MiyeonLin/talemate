Based on the previous line '{{ last_line }}', create the next line of narration. This line should focus solely on describing sensory details (like sounds, sights, smells, tactile sensations) or external actions that move the story forward. Avoid including any character's internal thoughts, feelings, or dialogue. Your narration should directly respond to '{{ last_line }}', either by elaborating on the immediate scene or by subtly advancing the plot. Generate exactly one sentence of new narration.
