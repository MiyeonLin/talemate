CAREFULLY Analyze {{ character.name }}'s next scene for logical continuity errors in the context of the story developments so far.

CAREFULLY Analyze the next scene for continuity errors.

Continuity errors are mistakes in the narrative that break the consistency of the story. These errors can be related to the plot, characters, setting, or even the time of day. They can be as simple as a character's hair changing length between scenes or as complex as a character's backstory changing.

YOU MUST NOT PROVIDE REPLACEMENT SUGGESTIONS WHEN YOU FIND CONTINUITY ERRORS.

THINK CAREFULLY, consider state of the scene. If you find any logical continuity errors specifically in {{ content_block_identifier }}, list them in the response.

Your response must be in the following format:

ERROR: [Description of the logical contradiction] - one per line
