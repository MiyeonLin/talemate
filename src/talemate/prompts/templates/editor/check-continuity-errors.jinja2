What are continuity errors?

Continuity errors are mistakes in a story that occur when something changes from one scene to the next. This could be a character's appearance, the time of day, or even the weather. These errors can be distracting for the reader and can take them out of the story. It's important to catch these errors and fix them before the story is published.

Carefully analyze this continuation of the scene for continuity errors:

```
{{ content }}
```

If there are continuity errors, rewrite the entire text to fix them. In order for us to easily locate your changed text please use the following format:

```fixed
the fixed text (complete, not individual lines)
```

THIS IS NOT A REVISION TASK. DO NOT CHANGE THE MEANING OF THE TEXT. ONLY FIX CONTINUITY ERRORS.
