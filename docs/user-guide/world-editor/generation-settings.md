## Applying a writing style

Once there is a writing style template you can select it from the dropdown list.

## Applying spice

Spice is a way to add some randomness to the generated content.

Spices are managed through [templates](/user-guide/world-editor/templates/).

Once there is a spice template you can select it from the dropdown list.

By default it will set a `10%` chance for spice to be applied to the generated content. You can click the :material-minus: and :material-plus: buttons to adjust the spice chance.

!!! tip
    Holding `ctrl` while clicking the buttons will adjust fully to `10%` or `100%`.

    You can also hold `ctrl` when selecting the spice in the dropdown to immediately set the spice chance to `100%`.

So if you are generating 10 character attributes, and have the spice chance set to `10%`, then on average 1 of the attributes will have spice applied.

If you are generating one specific attribute and want to ensure there is spice applied, you can set the spice chance to `100%`.
